# ðŸš§ Welcome to RoboRacing Micromouse ðŸš§
## What is Micromouse?
Micromouse is a new member program designed with the intention of providing an introduction to the electrical and firmware side of developing robots as a part of RoboRacing, while also preparing for a fun and competitive racing competition! Members will work on their own "mouse" that will be able to solve a 16x16 maze as quickly as possible.

> Watch a detailed overview of the competition by the Veritasium YouTube Channel
